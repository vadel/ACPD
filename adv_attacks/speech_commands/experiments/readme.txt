N=number of inputs per class. 
The inputs are stored for each class in an individual folder. 
Additionaly, the file "files_N_1000.npy" contain all the filenames alternated
(e.g., the 12*1000 files in which all the inputs of the 12 classes are alternated).
The file "labels_N_1000.npy" contains the corresponding ground-truth classes for the file "files_N_1000.npy".
